### I’m a mixed-methods UX researcher with 6+ years of experience turning user insights into actionable product improvements.

I thrive on tackling complex challenges in health tech, making technology more accessible and equitable through data-driven storytelling and deeply understanding users. With a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction, I specialize in digital health, accessibility, and neurodiversity, using mixed methods to drive inclusive, user-centered design.
