I am a human computer interaction researcher and third-year PhD student in <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media">Computational Media</a> at UC Santa Cruz with a background in cognitive science and healthcare. My research interests include digital mental health, accessibility, and behavior change. My work focuses on alternative support systems for neurodiverse individuals and people with psychosocial disabilities, including community-based avenues for support. I am passionate about using and evaluating technology to improve and support wellbeing and inclusive experiences.

My current projects cover topics such as: 
* Social Media Community Support and Care
* Accessibile Education and Social Media Practices
* Behavior Change Interventions
