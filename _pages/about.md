I am a human computer interaction researcher and third-year PhD student in <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media">Computational Media</a> at UC Santa Cruz with a background in cognitive science and healthcare. My research interests include digital mental health and behavior change. My work focuses on alternative support systems for neurodiverse individuals and people with psychosocial disabilities including community-based avenues for support. I am passionate about using and evaluating technology to improve and support wellbeing and inclusive experiences.

My current work focuses on alternative methods of mental health support, online health communities, accessibility, and behavior change.
