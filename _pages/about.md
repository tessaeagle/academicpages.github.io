I am a human computer interaction researcher and third-year PhD student in <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media">Computational Media</a> at UC Santa Cruz with a background in cognitive science and healthcare. My research interests include digital mental health, behavior change, and support for neurodivergent individuals. I am passionate about using and evaluating technology to improve people's wellbeing. 

My current work focuses on alternative methods of mental health support, online health communities, accessibility, and behavior change.
