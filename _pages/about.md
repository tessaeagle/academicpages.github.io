## UX and Accessibility Researcher
I am a mixed-methods human-computer interaction researcher and fifth-year PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media">Computational Media</a> at UC Santa Cruz with a background in cognitive science, clinical healthcare, and tech. My research interests include neurodivergence and tech, digital mental health, accessibility, and online communities. My work sits at the intersection of HCI, Disability Studies, and Medical Anthropology. I use primarily qualitative methods to study alternative support systems for neurodivergent individuals and people with psychosocial disabilities, including community-based avenues for support. I am passionate about using and evaluating technology to improve and support wellbeing and inclusive experiences.

My current projects cover topics such as: 
* Care in ADHD Social Media Communities [(ASSETS Paper)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OBNMfZmTm036DeW_ZPJz7g6Q6IBvZRyj/view)
* Tensions between Disabled Communities and Medical Institutions
* Communities as Experts

I anticipate completing my PhD in Summer 2024. **I'm on the job market for industry UX Research roles or post-docs starting in Summer 2024.** Please reach out if you have openings or know of interesting opportunities :) Feel free to email me at teagle [at] ucsc [dot] edu, connect with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tessuheagle">Twitter</a>, or read more about my experience: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16zLvKctehJvZacTqg7H17zGcpJegcKPz/view?usp=sharing">Resume</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fVXjq2zpsLfV2D0ZVPjSc5PEJuSGxBjOFSl-BDnDwGc/edit?usp=sharing">Full CV</a>
