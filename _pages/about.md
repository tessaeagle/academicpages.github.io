I am a human computer interaction researcher and fourth-year PhD student in <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media">Computational Media</a> at UC Santa Cruz with a background in cognitive science, clinical healthcare, and tech. My research interests include digital mental health, accessibility, and online communities. My work focuses on alternative support systems for neurodivergent individuals and people with psychosocial disabilities, including community-based avenues for support. I am passionate about using and evaluating technology to improve and support wellbeing and inclusive experiences.

My current projects cover topics such as: 
* Social Media Community Support and Care
* Accessible Education and Social Media Practices
* Tensions between tradtional medical systems and disabled communities
