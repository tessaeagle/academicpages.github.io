I am a mixed-methods human-computer interaction researcher and fifth-year PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media">Computational Media</a> at UC Santa Cruz with a background in cognitive science, clinical healthcare, and tech. My work sits at the intersection of HCI, Disability Studies, and Medical Anthropology. I use primarily qualitative methods to study online support systems for neurodivergent individuals and people with psychosocial disabilities. I am passionate about using and evaluating technology to improve and support wellbeing and inclusive experiences.
