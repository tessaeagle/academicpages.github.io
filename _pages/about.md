### I am a mixed-methods UX researcher with 6+ years of tech experience proven in translating user insights into actionable product improvements. 

I help to improve the experience of technology and products for end users and make technology more accessible and equitable through data-driven storytelling. My expertise lies in driving user-centered design by deeply understanding communities and their needs.

I thrive on tackling big and messy questions in the health tech space and am passionate about supporting well-being and inclusive technology experiences. I recently completed my PhD in Human-Computer Interaction, researching social media, digital health, neurodiversity, and accessibility.
