## Chatbot Background
Users of mobile apps for mental health are seeking low-cost, stigma-free solutions that are readily accessible and provide support and treatment recommendations. Apps are not a panacea but may provide help to those without other options. There is a clear need for unbiased information on MH apps and third-party systems can provide this. Current app analysis sites have limitations and finding a suitable app on these sites or the app stores can be overwhelming. Providing users with recommendations can increase the speed of decision making [1], but pior app recommender systems have required user app history to make recommendations [2,3]. Task-oriented conversational agents can interact with customers helping them find items or services more effectively [4].

There are currently a small number of academic websites that conduct expert evaluations of mental health apps, but these are ineffective due to constantly evolving apps making site information obsolete as well as the costs involved in generating expert reviews. These sites allow filtering based on several factors, but do not provide personalized options on a user-by-user basis. We developed two rule-based chatbots for providing mental health app recommendations. 

**Project Year:** 2020-2021
**Project Goal:** Develop and compare two interactive systems to recommend mental health mobile apps compared against the app store<br>

**Research Questions:**
- Does providing recommendations ease decision making?
- Do users prefer searching for apps on their own or being guided?
- How trustworthy do users find third-party app recommendations?
- What information do users want when making download decisions?

**Methods Used:** User Personas (design + testing), Competitive Analysis, Task Analysis, Interviews

### User Tasks
Within-Subjects design (n = 16, average age = 30.1)
- Randomized into one of three personas

Think-Aloud Task Analysis
- Play/App Store as control
- Select an app that fits the persona with each search method (randomized order)
- Testing two designs (read more about the design process in [this project](https://tessaeagle.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-32/))
- Participant screen sharing

Participants rated methods on:
- Usability (UMUX scale)
- Confidence in app selected
- Efficiency
- Quality of recommendations
- Overall preference

Semi-structured interview to conclude
