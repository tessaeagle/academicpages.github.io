## Chatbot Development
**Goal:** Develop a chatbot system to recommend mental health mobile apps and quickly reduce a large set of apps to a handful of personalized options

## App recommendations
- Clear need for unbiased information on MH apps, Third-party systems can provide this
- Current sites have limitations, Finding a suitable app can be overwhelming
- Recommendations can increase the speed of decision making [1]
- Prior app rec sys have required user app history to make recommendations [2,3]

## Conversational recommendations
- CRS interact with users via text or preset to elicit preferences
- Task-oriented CAs can interact with customers helping them find items or services more effectively [4]

There are currently a small number of academic websites that conduct expert evaluations of mental health apps, but these are ineffective due to constantly evolving apps making site information obsolete as well as the costs involved in generating expert reviews. These sites allow filtering based on several factors, but do not provide personalized options on a user-by-user basis.

We developed two rule-based chatbots for providing mental health app recommendations. Based upon our pilot interviews and app store analysis, we decided on two models: Need-based and feature-based.

## Methods
- User Personas
- Competitive Analysis
- Conversational Design

## Chatbot Development
- Utilized the Botsociety conversational interface designer
  - Options for text or voice-based chatbots
  - Free educational plans with unlimited number of conversation paths
  - Design options for numerous integrations e.g., What’sApp, Facebook Messenger, Google Home/Alexa, Slack, etc.
- Created a rule-based chatbot
- Botsociety integrates with Google Dialogflow for future implementation of a natural language chatbot
