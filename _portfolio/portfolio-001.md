<img src='/images/ohcs.png'  alt = 'Model of online health communities. Traditional OHCs: A newly diagnosed person seeks information online. They find existing communities via Google, Facebook, and Reddit. They get education, support, validation, and resources. Unbounded online health communities: An undignosed person scrolls daily on TikTok. They start seeing content about ADHD, relating to content and reframing their past experiences. They then can use the info/strategies, self-diagnose, seek formal diagnoses, and get support.'>
