Utilizing the [Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) algorithm with our own tileset to generate computational art. We created a set of 77 tiles in Photoshop to attempt to generate randomized constellations using WFC. Each tile contained a combination of joints (circles) to represent stars, and arms (lines) to represent the drawing of constellations. Joints could connect to arms or blank tiles, while arms could connect to joints or other arms but not blank tiles as each constellation end had to be a star.
