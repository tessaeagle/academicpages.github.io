title: "Trust in Chatbots and Taxonomy of Breakdowns"
excerpt: This project evaluated two chatbot apps for mental health with three participants over the course of ten days. The chatbot with fewer communication breakdowns led to higher scores on Trust and Competence as well as stronger feelings of Working Alliance.<br><br><img src='/images/chatbot_breakdowns.png' alt = ''>"

**Project Year:** 2020 <br>

## Background and Motivation
- Mental health apps are increasingly prevalent, 12,000+ mental health apps available (Schueller et al., 2019)
- Apps and content around mental health are largely unregulated (Neary and Schueller, 2018), few apps backed up by research/RCTs/efficacy data
- Chatbots are increasingly utilized in this domain (e.g., Woebot, Wysa, Replika)
- Breakdowns in communication decrease trust in chatbots (Ashktorab et al., 2019)

**Research Questions:** <br>
- What features lead to increased perceptions of trustworthiness and competence in mental health chatbots? <br>
  - Hypothesis: Greater presence of communication breakdowns will lead to decreased perceptions of trust and working alliance <br>
  - Working Alliance: client/therapist relationship and shared goals toward positive change <br>
<br>

## Methods used: Diary Study, Standardized Scales
- Compared two mental health chatbot apps - Wysa and Woebot
- Diary Study - Participants used each app and kept a log of: Duration of conversations, Communication breakdowns experienced, Empathetic expressions or chatbot self-referencing
- Pre- and post- study surveys containing:
  - Source Credibility Measure (trust and competence)
  - Working Alliance Inventory	
- Dependent Variables: Measures of Trust, Competence, and Working Alliance
- Independent Variable: Number of communication breakdowns/errors

### Participants
- 3 participants, 10 days using each of the two apps
- Participants chatted with Woebot daily for an average of 9.7 minutes and with Wysa daily for an average of 13.2 minutes

## Results
<img src = '/images/chatbot_breakdowns.png' alt = ' '>

> P1: It [Woebot] seemed to genuinely care about how I was feeling, it was patient and respected my space (if I wanted it), and wanted me to feel better <br>
<br>

> P2: [Wysa] Repetitive not only in the activities, but also the CBT theories - every time, it says why the thought is unhelpful and how I can fix that by using positive thinking. There is no variation in its education <br>
<br>

> P3: Wysa is obviously unpolished. Woebot's conversations felt fluid, restricted, and clear. Unlike that, Wysa's conversations can be disrupted by bugs, innocuous treatment and interaction.  <br>


### Types of Breakdowns
|                **Conversation Flow**               | **Misunderstandings/Inability to respond** |           **Glitches**           |
|:--------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| Offering strange presets                           | Lack of acknowledgment                     | Typos                            |
| Abrupt shifts in topics                            | Inability to respond to emojis             | Repeated queries/circular convos |
| Ill-timed Jokes                                    | Inability to understand free text          | Lack of timely response          |
| Illusion of choice                                 | Continuing to an activity a user declined  |                                  |
| Providing two options that are both yeses          | Perceiving positive emotions as negative   |                                  |
| Lack of variety - must fit into the closest option |                                            |                                  |

### Working Alliance Inventory (WAI)
- Score out of 60 possible, higher = greater WA

|         | **Wysa** | **Woebot** |
|:-------:|:--------:|:----------:|
|    P1   |    25    |     35     |
|    P2   |    29    |     44     |
|    P3   |    20    |     28     |
| Average |   24.7   |    35.7    |

### Source Credibility Measure (SCM)
- Each subset score out of 42 possible, higher = better

|                      | **Wysa** | **Woebot** |
|----------------------|:--------:|:----------:|
|     **Competence (avg)** | 21.3     | 28         |
|          P1          |    21    |     26     |
|          P2          |    19    |     33     |
|          P3          |    24    |     25     |
|     **Caring (avg)**     | 25       | 34.3       |
|          P1          |    21    |     36     |
|          P2          |    31    |     36     |
|          P3          |    23    |     31     |
|     **Trust (avg)**      | 27.7     | 33.3       |

|          P3          |    25    |     32     |

## Discussion
**Woebot**
- Chatbot is the only feature
- Higher SCM + WAI scores
- Offers few free-text responses - less room for misunderstanding
- Still saw breakdowns though
- Woebot asks for feedback on individual messages, and at the end of each conversation

**Wysa**
- Chatbot is not the main feature
- Solely free-text responses open the app up to breakdowns
- May expect more from free response as itâ€™s more advanced 
- Offers only negative mood options - difficult to discuss positive days
- Users felt like they had to carry the conversation 
- Felt like more of a machine, whereas Woebot felt like more of a friend
