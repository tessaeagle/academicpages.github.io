**Project Year:** 2020 <br>

## Background and Motivation
- Mental health apps are increasingly prevalent
- 12,000+ mental health apps available (Schueller et al., 2019)
- Apps and content around mental health are largely unregulated (Neary and Schueller, 2018)
- Few apps backed up by research/RCTs/efficacy data
- Chatbots are increasingly utilized in this domain (e.g., Woebot, Wysa, Replika)
- Breakdowns in communication decrease trust in chatbots (Ashktorab et al., 2019)

**Research Questions:** <br>
- What features lead to increased perceptions of trustworthiness and competence in mental health chatbots? <br>
  - Hypothesis: Greater presence of communication breakdowns will lead to decreased perceptions of trust and working alliance <br>
  - Working Alliance: client/therapist relationship and shared goals toward positive change <br>
<br>

## Methods used: Diary Study, Standardized Scales
- Compared two mental health chatbot apps - Wysa and Woebot
- Diary Study - Participants used each app and kept a log of: Duration of conversations, Communication breakdowns experienced, Empathetic expressions or chatbot self-referencing
- Pre- and post- study surveys containing:
  - Source Credibility Measure (trust and competence)
  - Working Alliance Inventory	
- Dependent Variables: Measures of Trust, Competence, and Working Alliance
- Independent Variable: Number of communication breakdowns/errors

### Participants
- 3 participants, 10 days using each of the two apps

## Results

### Source Credibility Measure
- Each subset score out of 42 possible, higher = better
