To test another method of app recommendation (aside from the above chatbot), we also prototyped a website that acts as an alternative to the traditional app stores. We implemented a small set of initial questions to filter apps for presentation to the user. Users are then able to see how well apps match their wants, filter based on features, and view a subset of relevant user reviews.
