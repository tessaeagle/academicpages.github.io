## Background
- Mental health-related diagnoses are increasing over time. 
- Many people with mental health diagnoses do not receive appropriate treatment
- Mental health mobile apps have proliferated -> 12,000-20,000 estimated
- There is a need and want for alternatives to traditional treatment
- Informed decisions around mental health apps require external information sources

Many apps utilize freemium payment models
- Combination of free and paid features
- Concerned with converting free users to paying subscribers
Freemium apps may:
- Offer limited functionality, pay for advanced features
- Have limited-duration free trials
- Place limits on free versions (e.g., usage caps)
- Allow users to pay to improve their user experience, e.g., by removing advertisements


**Project Goal:** Examine whether common freemium payment practices in popular mental health apps have negative outcomes for users based on user review analysis <br>
**Project Year:** 2019-2020 <br>
