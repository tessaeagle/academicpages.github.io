## Background

There are currently a small number of academic websites that conduct expert evaluations of mental health apps, but these are ineffective due to constantly evolving apps making site information obsolete as well as the costs involved in generating expert reviews. These sites allow filtering based on several factors, but do not provide personalized options on a user-by-user basis. We developed two rule-based chatbots for providing mental health app recommendations.
