## Background
As part of a larger project exploring how people search for apps and how to improve their experience, we designed two systems to provide users with personalized suggestions. To test another method of app recommendation (aside from the [above chatbot](https://tessaeagle.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/)), we also prototyped a more traditional website interface that acts as an alternative to the traditional app stores. We implemented a small set of initial questions to filter apps for presentation to the user. Users are then able to see how well apps match their wants, filter based on features, and view a subset of relevant user reviews. 

**Project Goal:** creating a better search experience than the App/Play Stores

## Prototype Development
Our initial design considerations stemmed from our goal of creating a better search experience than the App/Play Stores. We conducted competitive analyses of the app stores as well as two academic app review websites to identify areas for improvement. We began with the idea of a website that built on the familiar interface and experience of searching app stores while also incorporating transparency around features and functionality as with Psyberguide and MIND Apps. The academic websites had several weaknesses that we wanted to address in our design. Notably, they provided a level of information that would be overwhelming to target users and the expert review process seemed more suited for clinicians interested in recommending validated apps to their patients. A pitfall of the academic website's reliance on expert reviews islies in the time intensive nature of providing such analyses and the speed at which they can become outdated due to app updates. However, wWe chose to incorporate expert reviews in our design to explore whether users found them useful or unnecessary. 

Our system, Kaizen, was designed in Figma, a free, collaborative interface design tool commonly used in UI design and prototyping. Kaizen has two components, an interactive search that walks users through eight questions asking about their preferences (Figure 1), and an app presentation page that displays eight relevant apps to users based on their responses. The app presentation page displaysed the percent match between a user and an app, and includesed a sidebar with editable app filters such as price and features included. Users are then able to see how well apps match their wants, filter based on features, and view a subset of relevant user reviews. Each app could be hovered over to see the percent match (Figure 2) and clicked on to bring users to a larger description of the app akin to those of the app stores. These pages included traditional information such as developer descriptions and screenshots of the user interface, but was updated to include an in-depth breakdown of user reviews. Reviews were separated into positive and negative tabs (Figure 3) and further categorized under headings pertaining to content extracted from user reviews (e.g. reviews that discuss Sleep or Meditations). We explore the potential utility of user review analysis to extract information to estimate and score the effectiveness of relevant app features (Figure XX). To compare with other app review websites, we also included fictional expert reviews by clinicians to ideate and test user interest in scientific validation of apps.
