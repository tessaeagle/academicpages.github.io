## Background
Mental Health and App-Based Treatment
- Mental health-related diagnoses are increasing over time
- Many people with mental health diagnoses do not receive appropriate treatment
- Mental health mobile apps have proliferated -> 12,000-20,000 estimated
- There is a need and want for alternatives to traditional treatment
- Informed decisions around mental health apps require external information sources

Many apps utilize freemium payment models
- Combination of free and paid features
- Concerned with converting free users to paying subscribers
Freemium apps may:
- Offer limited functionality, pay for advanced features
- Have limited-duration free trials
- Place limits on free versions (e.g., usage caps)
- Allow users to pay to improve their user experience, e.g., by removing advertisements


**Project Goal:** Examine whether common freemium payment practices in popular mental health apps have negative outcomes for users based on user review analysis <br>
**Research Questions:**<br>
- What negative user outcomes can result from mental health apps that utilize freemium payment models? <br>
- What sub-types of mental health apps use freemium strategies, and what features are most commonly charged for? <br>
**Project Year:** 2019-2020 <br>

**Methods used:** Competitive Analysis, Content Analysis
- Identified 41 highly downloaded apps through keyword search on Google Play Store
- Downloaded 41k reviews (~1000/app) left by users (Half positive/neutral reviews (3-5 stars) and half negative (1-2 stars))
- Developed a codebook around self-described negative user outcomes resulting from freemium app design
- Reviews coded for negative themes after consensus process

## Results
- ~80% of apps utilized a freemium model
- This restricted free access to a subset of basic features
- This also limited the duration of free features
- Thematic analysis of 41k reviews yielded 1825 negative outcome examples across 41 apps (4.3% of the 41K reviews)


## Implications
