**Project Year:** 2023 <br>

## Background
Usability testing of a mixed-reality product experience aimed at improving work productivity.


## Research Questions
- What are the possible challenges of going through the unboxing and onboarding process?
- What are the most essential onboarding features for first-time users? 


## Methods
**Moderated Usability Testing, Interviewing, Task Analysis**
- 17 participants (9 women, 8 men) from the SF Bay Area in our target audience
- Recruitment via Respondent.io and UserInterviews
- Pre-task interview, structured task, post-task interview and exploration of product-market fit
- Between-Subjects Evaluation of onboarding process
  - **Two groups:** One with no guidance who were left to self-explore, one with a guided introduction to product features

## Main Insights
- Participants needed more visual guidance on opening and positioning the device
- Further instructions were needed for a few key features
- Participants wanted customization options before a walkthrough of basic settings
