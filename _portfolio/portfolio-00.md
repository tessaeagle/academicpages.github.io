title: "Unbounded Social Media Communities for Identity Discovery"
excerpt: "ADHD has been sensationalized by the media. 'Everyone has it now' and yet it remains underdiagnosed. Social media is actually providing a service to many who have gone undiagnosed their entire lives, wondering why they feel different. A different take on social media and ADHD. <br><br><img src='/images/ohcs.png'>"

## Background

**Project Year:** 2021 - 2023

## Objective and Motivation
- Adult ADHD and ADHD presentation in gender and racially-diverse populations is understudied
- Neurodivergence is understudied within HCI
- Technology designed for disabled and ND populations has been historically ableist

## Research Question
How does the ADHD community leverage existing social media platforms to provide support previously contained within domain-specific online health communities?

## Methods
- Digital Ethnography of ADHD content (photo/video posts, comments/replies) and communities on TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram
- Collection and observation Summer 2021 - Winter 2022
- Coded data inductively

## Main Themes
- Discovering ADHD and Navigating Diagnosis
- Navigating a Neurotypical World
- Finding Acceptance and Validation

## Proposal: conceptualizing these integrated OHC on open social media platforms as the â€œUnbounded Online Health Communities''
- Traditional OHCs provide isolated health-related support and are domain-specific
- Unbounded OHCs = Communities that live on open, algorithmically-driven social media platforms
- Broadens potential membership reach!

## Considerations
- Broaden recruitment to include individuals with self-diagnoses and those traditionally excluded from ADHD research
- Consider how to facilitate and promote knowledge sharing outside of medical contexts
- Continual calls to design with neurodivergent communities and listen to what they need
