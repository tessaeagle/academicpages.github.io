## Overview
This zine was completed using [Electric Zine Maker](https://alienmelon.itch.io/electric-zine-maker) for [Professor Nathan Altice's](http://metopal.com/about/) course *Media Constellations* in Winter 2021. The goal was to capture our thoughts and reflections on the course readings through which we explored the meandering path of what is traditonally viewed as a linear media history. We discussed questions such as *Who decides what media is worth preserving?* and *What technology/people get forgotten in popular narratives of computing?*. 

**Project Year:** Winter 2021
