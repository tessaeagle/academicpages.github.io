## Background
Understanding the work habits, social media usage, and purchasing behaviors of a hardware and software productivity product's target audience.

## Objectives and Research Questions
- Who do our target audience follow online as opinion leaders?
- Who do they trust before buying a new product (people and websites)? 
- What social media communities are they most active on and why?
- What work applications do our TA use at work (top 5) and what can they not live without?

## Methods
