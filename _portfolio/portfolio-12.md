R has a built in package for [data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-08/readme.md) from the show Friends. It contains speaker and dialogue data broken down by season and episode. I tested out using a waffle chart to display the ratio of time each main character spent talking in each of the ten seasons.<br>

This was my first ever attempt at making a map in ggplot and it was a frustrating and time-intensive plot. I used [data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-08-18/readme.md) on extinct plants and those at risk of extinction to visually explore where plants are under threat globally. I combined the map with a simple dot plot where I filtered for the top threats to endangered plants. <br>
