## Background
Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is sometimes viewed as a childhood disorder; however, symptoms often extend into adulthood. Many individuals remain undiagnosed into adulthood, often leading to academic difficulties. Receiving educational accommodations typically requires a diagnosis, excluding undiagnosed or self-diagnosed students. Social media presents a rich source of firsthand experiences as a student with ADHD. Informed by accessibility guidelines, we crowdsource recommendations to develop an informational resource for structuring higher education courses with neurodivergent students in mind. The final resource consists of 22 pages with 89 items compiled from 161 tweets. Initial feedback from a small number of graduate teaching assistants indicates the utility of this resource and suggests areas for improvement.

**Project Goal:** Crowdsource recommendations from neurodiverse social media users to create an online resource for professors and TAs to make courses more accessible for all students
