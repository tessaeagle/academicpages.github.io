## Background
Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is sometimes viewed as a childhood disorder; however, symptoms often extend into adulthood. Many individuals remain undiagnosed into adulthood, often leading to academic difficulties. Receiving educational accommodations typically requires a diagnosis, excluding undiagnosed or self-diagnosed students. Social media presents a rich source of firsthand experiences as a student with ADHD. Informed by accessibility guidelines, we crowdsource recommendations to develop an informational resource for structuring higher education courses with neurodivergent students in mind. The final resource consists of 22 pages with 89 items compiled from 161 tweets. Initial feedback from a small number of graduate teaching assistants indicates the utility of this resource and suggests areas for improvement.

**Project Goal:** Crowdsource recommendations from neurodiverse social media users to create an online resource for professors and TAs to make courses more accessible for all students

## Methods
We conducted a search of social networking sites (Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram) from late September to early November of 2021, to crowdsource suggestions for improving educational experiences and outcomes for neurodivergent individuals. Various keywords were used to find content related to school and education accommodations for neurodivergent and disabled individuals. Combinations of hashtags and keywords such as ADHD, college/university, ADHD tips, accommodations, neurodivergent, professor, disability, and education were reviewed for pertinent content. Suggestions were also discovered as links or comments from other posts or threads (e.g., Twitter responses, TikTok comments), and not solely through the use of hashtags and keyword searches. 



**Methods Used:** Digital Ethnography, Crowdsourcing, Review of Digital Accessibility Guidelines, Application of Universal Design for Learning
