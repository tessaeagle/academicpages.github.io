## Background

**Project Year:** 2022 - present

## Objective
How do neurodivergent individuals define and use body doubling?

**Goals:**
- Establishing body doubling as an adaptive strategy for task completion/initiation for ND individuals
- Get a standard, community-defined definition published in peer-reviewed research

## Methods
- Survey of 220 neurodivergent participants
- Recruited from neurodivergent  subreddits and personal Twitter and TikTok accounts
- Explored themes around knowledge of, experiences with, and use of body doubling
- Average age = 34.2, range from 18 - 72

## What is body doubling?
- Having someone in the room (n = 127) or on a call/chat (n = 27)
- To accomplish a task (n = 65) / be productive (n = 38)
- Tasks may be different (n = 65) or  similar (n = 13)
- Form of accountability (n = 23) and helps one stay on task (n = 21)
