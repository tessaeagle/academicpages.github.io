## Background

**Project Year:** 2022 - 2024 <br><br>
[Extended Abstract](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3597638.3614486)

## Objectives
- Explore how neurodivergent individuals define and use body doubling.
- Establish body doubling as an adaptive strategy for task completion/initiation for ND individuals
- Publish a community-driven definition of a colloquial phenomenon

## Methods
- Survey of 220 neurodivergent participants
- Recruited from neurodivergent  subreddits and personal Twitter and TikTok accounts
- Explored themes around knowledge of, experiences with, and use of body doubling
- Average age = 34.2, range from 18 - 72

## What is body doubling?
- Having someone in the room (n = 127) or on a call/chat (n = 27)
- To accomplish a task (n = 65) / be productive (n = 38)
- Tasks may be different (n = 65) or  similar (n = 13)
- Form of accountability (n = 23) and helps one stay on task (n = 21)

## Mapping Body Doubling
We propose that body doubling is a spectrum of (primarily) two things --  Space/Time and Mutuality (see below figure). This model reflects the flexibility we saw participants utilizing.
First, a spectrum of **space and temporality** exists. This addresses the "liveness" of the body double. The space-time spectrum ranges from *happening in real-time, in a shared space* to *pre-recorded in a different space*. Second, there are differing levels of **mutuality and awareness** on the part of the entity acting as the body double. This spectrum ranges from *someone who knows what you are doing and you can be accountable to*, to *someone sharing a space but unaware of their role as a body double*.
