## Background
In June 2020, I began participating in a weekly data visualization challenge aimed at improving data wrangling and presentation skills. A subset of my work is presented here, but for further viewing see the below repositories for all of my visualizations with their respective R code. Each week, I aimed to try implementing a new type of chart, feature, or color palette to expand my coding skillset. Some of them took hours and some less than an hour depdening on the initial dataset and my goals for that week.

This visualization was made as part of the 30 Day Chart Challenge. The prompt for this day was "experimental". I had been wanting to test out different implemntations of coord_polar to explore circular visualizations.
