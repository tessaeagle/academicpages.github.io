## Background
This project initially began as a static visualization I completed for the Tidy Tuesday weekly data challenge. Tidy Tuesday is a “weekly social data project in R” to practice data manipulation and presentation with the R programming language. Each week, a new dataset is provided for participants to work with and post their visualizations to the Tidy Tuesday Twitter community. I began participating in June 2020 to improve my R skills. The project described here is an extension of my submission for Tidy Tuesday on September 15, 2020. The dataset for this week was from Urban Institute and contained data on US Government spending on kids for various programs between 1997 and 2016. For this week, I made a GIF in ggplot2 - a package for creating data visualizations based upon the grammar of graphics - of the money spent on SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) by each state on a per child basis. The gif displays the spending broken down by year from 1997-2016 (see Figure 1).
