## Overview
This zine was completed using [Electric Zine Maker](https://alienmelon.itch.io/electric-zine-maker) for [Professor Nathan Altice's](http://metopal.com/about/) course *Media Constellations* in Winter 2021. The goal was to capture our thoughts and reflections on the course readings through which we explored the meandering path of what is traditonally viewed as a linear media history.

**Project Year:** Winter 2021
